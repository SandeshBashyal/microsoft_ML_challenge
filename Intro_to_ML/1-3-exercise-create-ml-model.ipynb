        "> - Notebooks are made up of *cells*. Some cells (like this one) contain *markdown* text, while others (like the one beneath this one) contain code.\n",
        "> - You can run each code cell by using the **&#9658; Run** button. the **&#9658; Run** button will show up when you hover over the cell.\n",
        "> - The output from each code cell will be displayed immediately below the cell.\n",
        "> - Even though the code cells can be run individually, some variables used in the code are global to the notebook. That means that you should run all of the code cells <u>**in order**</u>. There may be dependencies between code cells, so if you skip a cell, subsequent cells might not run correctly.\n",
